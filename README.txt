Paladins Randomizer is a simple web application designed to give users a fun challenge by randomly generating every part of their Paladins experience. Users can randomize their champion, items, and even their loadout, all by simply pressing a few buttons.

Outline:
1. Allow users to randomize their champion. This should be on by default.

2. Allow users to randomize their items. This should be off by default. All 4 items will be generated at once, not just 1 at a time.

3. Allow users to randomize their loadouts. This should be off by default. The simplest way to do this is to create a graphic containing the 2 rows and columns of sets of 4 cards as shown in the loadout creation screen of each champion, then simply highlight the location of which cards the user should pick, and overlay the numbers over that. It should look something like this:

_ _ 4 _     _ 2 1 _
_ 3 _ _     _ 5 _ _

4. Allow users to randomize all selected categories with the press of one button.

5. Include links to social media at the footer of the page, to drive traffic to the AndrewChicken channels.

6. Display all the previous points in a clean, aesthetically pleasing interface that is easy to navigate.
